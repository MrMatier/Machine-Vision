# Image Compression and Denoising

This directory focuses on image compression and the various denoising methods used in image processing, including the implementation of different orthogonal transforms.

## Contents

- **Orthogonal Transforms for Compression**: Study and implementation of various orthogonal transforms like the Fourier Transform, Cosine Transform, and Wavelet Transform for image compression. These methods are known for their efficiency in transforming image data into a compact frequency representation, which is crucial for reducing file size without significant loss of quality.
- **Image Compression Techniques**: Exploration of algorithms that reduce the image file size for storage efficiency, including lossless and lossy compression methods.
- **Denoising Algorithms**: Application of various denoising methods to enhance image quality. This includes traditional noise reduction techniques as well as modern approaches that utilize orthogonal transforms to differentiate between signal and noise.

## Report
