# Image Scaling Techniques

This directory houses projects focused on various image scaling methods as well as Interpolation of a function. Here I explored different scaling algorithms and their implementation in Python.

## Contents

- **Convolution-Based Scaling**: Implements image scaling using convolution with different kernels.
- **Bilinear Interpolation**: Demonstrates image scaling using bilinear interpolation.
- **Nearest Neighbor**: Explores the nearest neighbor approach for image scaling.
- **Linear Signal Interpolation**: A study on linear interpolation applied to signal processing.

## Report

The accompanying PDF report provides a thorough analysis, including visualizations, conclusions, and comparisons between the different scaling methods.
