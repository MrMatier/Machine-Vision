# Demosaicing Methods

In this directory, I dive into various demosaicing techniques, applying them to image processing tasks to reconstruct full-color images from incomplete color samples.

## Contents

- **Fuji X-Trans Demosaicing**: Application of demosaicing algorithms tailored for the Fuji X-Trans sensor pattern.
- **Interpolation-Based Demosaicing**: Utilizing interpolation methods to perform demosaicing.
- **2D Convolution Demosaicing**: Implementing 2D convolution with different kernels for demosaicing.
- **Mozaicking and Demosaicking Applications**: Exploring both the mozaicking process and its inverse, demosaicking, across various contexts.
- **Practical Convolution Applications**: Detailing the use-cases of convolution in image processing beyond demosaicing.

## Report

The PDF report contains a comparative analysis of each technique, discussions on theory, and practical insights drawn from the implemented code.
