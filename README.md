# Machine Vision: Image and Signal Processing

This repository is a comprehensive resource dedicated to the exploration of image and signal processing techniques within the realm of machine vision. Contained herein are various Python-implemented projects that demonstrate the manipulation, transformation, and analysis of images and signals using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Repository Contents

The repository is organized into four main directories, each focusing on a distinct aspect of image and signal processing:

- **Image Scaling Techniques**
- **Demosaicing Methods**
- **Image Compression and Denoising**
- **Image Rotation Techniques**

Each directory contains a suite of Jupyter Notebooks that present the code, visual results, and a PDF report detailing the experiments, outcomes, and theoretical vs. practical considerations.

## Technologies

Throughout these projects, we utilize several Python libraries integral to processing and analyzing data:

- `opencv-python` : For comprehensive image processing tasks.
- `numpy`: Essential for high-performance scientific computing.
- `scikit-image` : For advanced image processing.
- `matplotlib`: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- `scipy`: For fundamental routines for scientific computing.
- `scikit-learn` : For machine learning and data mining.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
